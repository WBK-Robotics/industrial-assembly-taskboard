Robotic Assembly Instructions: Gear Assembly
============================================

Task 1: Two Gears
-----------------

The robot grasps the first gear, which is placed on a flat surface next to the Taskboard.
The robot orients and rotates the gear so that it is properly aligned for insertion.
The robot then inserts the first gear vertically onto one of the two pegs on the assembly component.

Next, the robot grasps the second gear.
The robot orients and rotates the second gear so that the mounting hole is aligned with the second peg. Additionally, the robot must rotate the gear so that the teeth of both gears do not collide in the next step.
Finally, the robot inserts the second gear vertically onto the remaining peg of the assembly component.
Success criteria: The two gears must be mounted onto the shafts of the assembly component in such a way that their teeth engage properly with each other. If a correct gear meshing is achieved, the assembly is considered successful.

Task 2: Gear with Helical Teeth
-------------------------------

The robot grasps the gear with helical teeth, which is positioned on a flat surface next to the Taskboard.
The robot orients and rotates the gear so that the hole in the gear is aligned with the peg of the assembly component. Additionally, the robot must ensure that the teeth do not collide.
The robot then inserts the gear vertically onto the peg. Due to the helical teeth, one the Teeth of the two gears are gripping into each other the robot must rotate the gear while lowering it to achieve proper engagement.
Success criteria: The robot must place the gear fully onto the shaft of the assembly component so that there is no gap between the underside of the gear and the surface of the component, ensuring that no further movement occurs once the robot releases its grip. If these conditions are met, the assembly is considered successful.

Task 3: Three Gears
-------------------

The robot grasps one of the two gears with a groove.
The robot orients and rotates the gear so that it is properly aligned for insertion onto one of the two outer shafts of the assembly component. The groove must align with the key on the shaft.
The robot inserts the first gear vertically onto the shaft.

Next, the robot grasps the second grooved gear.
The robot orients and rotates this gear so that it is properly aligned with the second outer shaft. Again, the groove must match the key orientation.
The robot inserts the second gear vertically onto the second outer shaft.
Then, the robot rotates the two mounted gears into a position that allows the third gear to be inserted between them without colliding.
The robot grasps the third gear, which has no groove.
The robot orients and rotates the gear so that both the mounting hole and the teeth align correctly with the middle peg and the two outer gears.
Finally, the robot inserts the third gear vertically onto the middle peg of the assembly component.
Success criteria: The instructions above describe only one possible assembly sequence; alternative approaches are also valid if they achieve the following result.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All three gears must be mounted onto the shafts of the assembly component with their teeth properly engaged. Additionally, the underside of each gear must be in contact with the surface of the component. 								          If both conditions are met, the assembly is considered successful.
