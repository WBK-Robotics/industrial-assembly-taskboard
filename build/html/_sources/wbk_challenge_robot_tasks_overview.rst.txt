Introduction

Like the assembly instructions, the indiviudal tasks are organized in modules but can be mixed and matched freely to create custom benchmarks.


How to use
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Pick the tasks you want to benchmark.
2. Read its **robotic assembly task** page to understand the required motions and tolerances.
3. Implement and test your robot program until the success criteria are met.
