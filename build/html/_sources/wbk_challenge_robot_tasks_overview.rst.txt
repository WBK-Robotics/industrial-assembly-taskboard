Task Descriptions
=================


This section describes all tasks of the industrial assembly task board.
Like the assembly instructions, the individual tasks are organized in modules but can be mixed and matched freely to create custom benchmarks.

How to use this guide
---------------------

1. Pick the tasks you want to benchmark.
2. Read its **robotic assembly task** page to understand the required motions and tolerances.
3. Implement and test your robot program until the success criteria are met.
