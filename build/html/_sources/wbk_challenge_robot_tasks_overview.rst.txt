Industrial Assembly Taskboard â€“ Robot Task Guide
=========================================

Introduction
------------

This section describes the **robot-level task definitions** for each industrial assembly challenge module.
Where the assembly instructions told you *how to build the hardware*, the pages listed below
detail *what your robot must do* (task sequence, constraints and success criteria)
when experimenting with each module.

How to use
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Pick the module you want to benchmark.
2. Read its **robotic assembly task** page to understand the required motions and tolerances.
3. Implement and test your robot program until the success criteria are met.
