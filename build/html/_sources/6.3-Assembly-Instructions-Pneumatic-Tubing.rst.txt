Assembly Instructions Pneumatic Tubing
======================================

Step 1: Prepare the Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Step 2: Setting up the pneumatic tubing task
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Place the two thread inserts over the holes of the Pneumatic tubing connector parts, ensuring that the smaller diameter is on the bottom side.
Proceed with the following steps:
Heat the insert – Use a soldering iron with a M8 tip that fits into the insert. Heat the insert until it reaches a temperature where it can melt the surrounding plastic.
Press the insert in – Gently apply pressure to push the insert into the hole while the plastic softens and conforms around it.
Allow cooling – Once in place, let the plastic cool and solidify, ensuring a strong mechanical bond.
Screw in the Pneumatic Push in fittings into the tread insert of the Pneumatic tubing connector parts.

Step 3: Setting up the Task on the Task Board
