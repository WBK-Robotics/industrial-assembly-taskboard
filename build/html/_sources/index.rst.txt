Industrial Assembly Task Board Documentation
============================================

Welcome to the documentation hub for the *Industrial Assembly Task Board* — a modular robotic
benchmark started by the wbk Institute of Production Science (Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology).  Here you will find everything needed to **build the taskboard
hardware** *and* **get your robot to perform each benchmark task**.

What you’ll find here
---------------------

* **Assembly Guide** – step‑by‑step hardware build instructions (3D‑printing,
  purchased fasteners, mounting sequence).

* **Robot Task Guide** – formal task definitions (motion sequence, tolerances and
  success criteria) for benchmarking your robot or algorithm on each module.

.. note::

   If you are new to the benchmark, follow the quick‑start steps below.  Power
   users can jump directly to the Assembly or Robot Task guides via the sidebar.


Quick‑Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Read the :doc:`wbk_challenge_overview` to build the base taskboard and all
   desired skill modules.

2. Choose a module and open its page in the :doc:`wbk_challenge_robot_tasks_overview`
   to understand the robot motions and evaluation metrics.

3. Implement your robot program, run experiments, and compare results!
