Robotic Assembly Instructions: Pick and Place
=============================================

Task 1: Housing Parts
---------------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A housing part is placed on a flat surface next to the Taskboard. Another housing part is already mounted on the Taskboard. The robot must pick up the loose housing part and place it centrally on top of the mounted part, ensuring correct alignment.

Test Objective:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This task evaluates the robot's ability to grasp, transport, and precisely align components with matching features, simulating assembly operations that require accurate positioning and orientation.

Success Criteria:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The housing part is placed on top of the mounted component with parallel alignment.
- The distance between the two flange surfaces is exactly 2 mm.
- The center axes of the aligned drill holes match, with a maximum rotational deviation of 1°.
- The housing part remains stationary after placement.

Task 2: Feather Key
-------------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A feather key is placed on a flat surface next to the Taskboard. 
The robot must pick up the feather key and insert it vertically into the groove of a shaft mounted on the Taskboard.

Test Objective:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This task evaluates the robot's ability to handle small parts, 
perform precise insertions, and maintain control during placement.

Success Criteria:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The feather key is fully inserted into the groove on the shaft.
- The feather key remains stationary after the robot releases it.

Task 3: Shim Ring
-----------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Shim rings are thin, precisely manufactured rings used in industry to adjust the axial position or spacing between machine components, 
ensuring correct alignment, preload, or clearance. 
In industrial settings, the required number of shim rings can vary depending on component tolerances, 
wear, or assembly variations. Therefore, the robot must autonomously determine how many shim rings to stack to reach the correct height—specifically, 
up to but not covering the groove on the shaft. 
This reflects real-world scenarios where automated systems 
must adapt to part variability and ensure assemblies meet strict tolerance requirements without manual intervention.

Test Objective:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This task evaluates the robot's ability to not just perform repetitive pick-and-place operations, 
but follow them to reach a specified target height as required in many industrial assembly tasks.
In this case it autonomously determine when to stop based on a visual reference.

Success Criteria:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Four shim rings are stacked onto the shaft, reaching the groove without covering it.
- The number of shim rings is determined autonomously by the robot.
- All placed shim rings remain stationary after placement.
