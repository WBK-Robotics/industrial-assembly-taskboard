Robotic Task Descriptions: Peg in Hole
======================================

Task 1: Round Peg
-----------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A round peg is positioned upright on a flat surface adjacent to the Taskboard. 
The task requires the peg to be inserted into a designated round hole in a target component.

Test Objective:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This task evaluates the robot's ability to handle cylindrical objects, perform precise alignment, 
and execute controlled insertion motions typical in industrial assembly processes.

Success Criteria:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The round peg is fully inserted into the designated hole.
- No  displacement of the peg occurs after the robot releases it.

Task 2: Splined Shaft Peg
-------------------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A splined shaft peg is positioned upright on a flat surface next to the Taskboard. 
The task requires the peg to be inserted into a matching splined hole in a target component.

Test Objective:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This task assesses the robot's capability to recognize and align keyed or splined features, ensuring correct orientation and fit during insertion.

Success Criteria:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The splined shaft peg is fully inserted into the matching splined hole.
- No  displacement of the peg occurs after the robot releases it.

Task 3: BNC-Connector
---------------------

Description:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
A male BNC connector is positioned on a flat surface next to the Taskboard. 
The task requires the connector to be inserted and locked into a corresponding female socket on the Taskboard.

Test Objective:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This task tests the robot's ability to perform insert-and-twist operations, requiring both translational and rotational alignment, 
as well as engagement of locking mechanisms.

Success Criteria:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The BNC connector is inserted such that both lugs of the plug reach the end of the guide slots in the socket.
- The connector is rotated to the locked position, as verified by a mechanical stop or electrical continuity check.
