# Industrial Assembly Task Board

![Industrial Assembly Task Board Logo](source/images/logo_with_text.png)

The **Industrial Assembly Task Board** is a modular robotic benchmark developed by the wbk Institute of Production Science at KIT. This repository provides everything needed to build the hardware and evaluate robotic systems on a range of realistic assembly tasks.

## Why This Task Board?

Robotic assembly is more complex than simple "peg-in-hole" tasks. This task board introduces challenges like precise tolerances, compliant assembly, and advanced planningâ€”reflecting real industrial scenarios. Its modular design lets you mix and match tasks to suit your research needs.

All 3D-printable files are available in the folder 3d_printing_files.

> **Note:** This is a starting point for exploring industrial assembly challenges. Contributions for new modules and tasks are welcome!

## Quick Start

1. Build the base task board and desired modules (see `wbk_challenge_overview`).
2. Review task definitions and evaluation metrics (`wbk_challenge_robot_tasks_overview`).
3. Implement your robot program, run experiments, and compare results.
