# Peg in Hole Tasks

This folder contains 3D-printable files for the "Peg in Hole" tasks, which are part of the Industrial Assembly Task Board. These tasks are designed to evaluate a robot's ability to handle precise insertion operations, a fundamental skill in robotic assembly.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 1: Round Shaft**
   - Involves inserting a round peg into a matching round hole.
   - Tests the robot's ability to align and insert components with minimal interference.

2. **Task 2: Splined Shaft**
   - Requires inserting a splined peg into a matching splined hole.
   - Evaluates the robot's capability to handle keyed components that require precise orientation.

3. **Task 3: BNC Connector**
   - Simulates the insertion of a BNC connector into its socket.
   - Challenges the robot to manage components with complex geometries and alignment requirements.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the subfolder for the specific task you want to build.
2. Use the provided 3D-printable files to fabricate the components.
3. Follow the assembly instructions in the documentation to set up the task.
