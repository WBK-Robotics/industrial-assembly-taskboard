# Gear Assembly Tasks

This folder contains 3D-printable files for the "Gear Assembly" tasks, which are part of the Industrial Assembly Task Board. These tasks are designed to evaluate a robot's ability to handle and assemble gears with varying levels of complexity, including alignment, meshing, and rotational coordination.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 1: Two Gears**
   - Involves mounting two spur gears onto parallel shafts so that their teeth mesh correctly.
   - Tests the robot's ability to align and seat gears while ensuring proper meshing.

2. **Task 2: Gear with Helical Teeth**
   - Requires mounting a helical gear onto a shaft, ensuring the teeth engage correctly with an existing gear.
   - Evaluates the robot's capability to handle components with non-standard tooth profiles, requiring simultaneous rotation and insertion.

3. **Task 3: Three Gears**
   - Involves mounting three gears (two with grooves and one without) onto three shafts, ensuring proper alignment and meshing.
   - Challenges the robot to plan the assembly sequence and coordinate shaft rotation to achieve correct gear engagement.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the subfolder for the specific task you want to build.
