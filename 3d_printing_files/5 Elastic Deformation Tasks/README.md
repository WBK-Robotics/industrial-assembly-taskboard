# Elastic Deformation Tasks

This folder contains 3D-printable files for the "Elastic Deformation" tasks, which are part of the Industrial Assembly Task Board. These tasks are designed to evaluate a robot's ability to handle components that require elastic deformation during assembly, such as snap hooks, springs, and circlips. These tasks simulate real-world challenges where components must be flexed or compressed to fit into place.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Task 1: Snap Hook**
   - Involves inserting a snap hook into a slot where it must flex to lock into place.
   - Tests the robot's ability to handle components requiring controlled deformation.

2. **Task 2: Spring**
   - Requires compressing a spring and placing it into a designated position.
   - Evaluates the robot's capability to manage components with high elasticity and precise placement.

3. **Task 3: Circlip**
   - Involves expanding a circlip and fitting it onto a shaft or into a groove.
   - Challenges the robot to handle components that require both deformation and precise alignment.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the subfolder for the specific task you want to build.
2. Use the provided 3D-printable files to fabricate the components.
3. Follow the assembly instructions in the documentation to set up the task.
