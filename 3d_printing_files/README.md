# 3D Printing Files for the Industrial Assembly Task Board

This folder contains all the 3D-printable files required to build the modules of the Industrial Assembly Task Board. The task board is designed to provide a modular and extensible benchmark for robotic assembly tasks, going beyond basic "peg-in-hole" examples to address more complex challenges encountered in industrial practice.

## Folder Structure

The files are organized into subfolders based on the type of task:

1. **Peg in Hole Tasks**
   - Tasks involving the insertion of components into shafts or holes, such as round shafts, splined shafts, and BNC connectors.

2. **Pick and Place Tasks**
   - Tasks requiring the robot to pick up and place components like housings, feather keys, and shim rings.

3. **Gear Assembly Tasks**
   - Tasks involving the assembly of gears, including spur gears, helical gears, and multi-gear configurations.

4. **Screws and Nuts Tasks**
   - Tasks focusing on the handling and assembly of screws and nuts, including scenarios with difficult accessibility and tilting challenges.

5. **Elastic Deformation Tasks**
   - Tasks that require handling components with elastic properties, such as snap hooks, springs, and circlips.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the task you want to build.
2. Use the provided 3D-printable files to fabricate the components.
3. Follow the assembly instructions in the documentation to set up the task board.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions to expand the task board with new modules and challenges. If you have ideas for additional tasks, please:

1. Create the necessary 3D-printable files.
2. Write a task description and success criteria.
3. Open a Pull Request in the [main repository](https://github.com/WBK-Robotics/industrial-assembly-taskboard).

Together, we can create a comprehensive benchmark for advancing robotic assembly systems.
